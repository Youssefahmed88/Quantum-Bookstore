## Key Principles and Design

### 1. Separation of Concerns  
The system separates responsibilities into distinct classes:

- **Inventory**: Manages stock and purchase transactions.
- **Book**: Contains book information and delegates purchase actions.
- **BookTypeRegistry**: Registers and manages different purchase handlers for book types.
- **Customer**: Represents a buyer interacting with the inventory.

This improves **maintainability** and **clarity**.

### 2. Extensibility  
Adding a new book type is easy ‚Äî just register a new handler in `BookTypeRegistry` with the purchase message format and logic, without changing other parts of the system.

### 3. Robust Validation and Error Handling  
Checks for valid quantities, emails, addresses, and stock availability ensure the system behaves correctly and safely.

## Usage

1. Register book types and their handlers via `BookTypeRegistry`.
2. Add books to the inventory.
3. Create customers and use their `checkout()` method to buy books.
4. Handle exceptions for invalid operations gracefully.
